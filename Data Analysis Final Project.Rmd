Analysis 1: The dataset was inspected, revealing various event types, product categories, and timestamps. Missing values were checked and found to be absent in the key columns, ensuring data reliability. The unique event types identified include 'view,' 'cart,' and 'purchase,' which represent different stages of customer interaction. The distribution of event types shows that 'view' events are the most frequent, with fewer 'cart' and 'purchase' events, indicating that customers primarily browse products before making a purchase decision. The analysis also revealed the top 10 product categories by purchase frequency, helping to identify the most popular products. Converting timestamps to a date-time format allowed the creation of new features such as 'event_hour' and 'event_day,' which will be useful for examining time-based patterns in customer behavior. These features enable deeper insights into customer interactions based on the time of day and day of the week. The pre-processing steps prepare the dataset for further exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing, providing a strong foundation for understanding customer behavior in the e-commerce platform.

Research Question:
Does adding items to the cart significantly increase the likelihood of purchase in an e-commerce environment?

Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): Adding items to the cart does not significantly increase the likelihood of purchase.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Adding items to the cart significantly increases the likelihood of purchase.

Analysis 2:

Histogram: Distribution of Event Types
The histogram shows that 'view' events are the most frequent, indicating that customers tend to browse products much more than they add them to the cart or make purchases. The lower frequency of 'cart' and 'purchase' events reflects the common pattern in e-commerce, where many customers explore products, but only a smaller portion proceed to purchase.

Ranking Plot: Top 10 Product Categories by Purchases
The ranking plot reveals the top 10 product categories with the highest number of purchases. This insight helps identify which product categories drive the most sales, providing businesses with key information on where to focus marketing efforts or product inventory. Categories with higher purchases may represent popular or trending items among customers.

Bar Plot: Effect of Product Category on Purchases
The bar plot provides a detailed breakdown of purchases across various product categories. By highlighting the top categories with the most purchases, this plot provides further insights into consumer preferences and can help businesses prioritize which categories to expand or promote based on customer demand.

Time Series Plot: Relationship Between Views and Purchases Over Time
The time series plot shows the hourly trends of views and purchases, illustrating how customer engagement (views) correlates with actual purchases throughout the day. This plot can uncover peak shopping hours, allowing businesses to tailor marketing campaigns, promotions, or staffing strategies to coincide with times when customer activity is highest, thus potentially increasing sales.

```{r}
# Prepare data for statistical tests
# Prepare data for the T-test

purchase_data <- data %>% filter(event_type == "purchase")

# 1.Parametric Test: T-test

t_test_result <- t.test(cart_data$event_hour, purchase_data$event_hour)

Analysis 3: Both tests indicate that there is a significant difference in the behavior of users who add items to the cart versus those who proceed to purchase directly. The extremely small p-value (2.2e-16) strongly supports the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁), meaning adding items to the cart significantly influences user behavior, increasing the likelihood of a purchase.

Synopsis of my Work
I hypothesized that adding items to the cart significantly increases the likelihood of a purchase in an e-commerce environment. To explore this, I first examined the Ecommerce Behavior Data from a multi-category store, focusing on event types such as "view," "cart," and "purchase," and visualized various patterns. Through data exploration, I created multiple visualizations to better understand the relationships in the dataset.

I started by using a histogram to analyze the distribution of event types (view, cart, and purchase). Next, I used a ranking plot to highlight the top 10 product categories based on purchases. Additionally, I created a bar plot to understand how product categories influence purchase behavior. Lastly, a time series plot was created to examine hourly trends in views and purchases, revealing temporal patterns in customer behavior.

Upon performing these visualizations, I found that purchase events were heavily influenced by users’ interactions with the cart. The top product categories were identified, and temporal patterns in views and purchases showed clear peak times, particularly aligning with cart actions.

To test hypothesis, I ran two statistical tests in R: a T-Test and a Mann-Whitney U Test. Both tests showed extremely low p-values (2.2e-16), indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis. The tests confirmed that adding items to the cart significantly influences the likelihood of purchase.

Outcome:
Data exploration revealed key insights into customer behavior and the effect of cart additions on purchases.
Both statistical tests (T-Test and Mann-Whitney U) were successfully run and showed significant results, supporting the alternative hypothesis.
