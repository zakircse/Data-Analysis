# Data-Analysis

## 📊 E-Commerce User Behavior Analysis

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer interactions in an e-commerce platform to predict purchase decisions using data-driven insights. It explores how actions like adding items to the cart impact the likelihood of purchase.

### 🧠 Research Question
Does adding items to the cart significantly increase the likelihood of purchase?

### 📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Ecommerce Behavior Data

Size: ~67 million events

Features: event type (view, cart, purchase), product ID, category, brand, price, user session metadata, timestamps.

### 📈 Key Analyses
Distribution of user actions (view, cart, purchase)

Top 10 product categories by purchase volume

Hourly trends in views and purchases

Visualizations: histograms, bar plots, time series

### 📊 Statistical Methods
T-Test and Mann-Whitney U Test to compare behavior patterns

Both tests showed significant results (p-value < 0.05), supporting the hypothesis that cart additions increase purchase likelihood

### 🧪 Conclusion
Customer behavior data reveals that cart actions are strong indicators of purchase intent, and time-based trends provide opportunities for strategic interventions (e.g., marketing, inventory planning).

### 📌 Tools & Libraries
R programming

Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, tidyr, reshape2, ggpubr, stats
